# Disaster Response Pipeline Project

## Project Description
In this project, we build a model to classify messages that are sent during disasters. There are 36 pre-defined categories, and examples of these categories include Aid Related, Medical Help, Search And Rescue, etc. The data set is provided by [Figure Eight](https://www.figure-eight.com/) containing real messages that were sent during disaster events.
This project contains a web app to input a message and get classification results.

## Installation
Python 3 with numpy, pandas, sqlalchemy, re, NLTK, pickle, Sklearn, plotly and flask libraries.

## File Descriptions
1. App folder including the templates folder and "run.py" for the web application
2. Data folder containing "DisasterResponse.db", "disaster_categories.csv", "disaster_messages.csv" and "process_data.py" for data cleaning and transfering.
3. Models folder including "classifier.pkl" and "train_classifier.py" for the Machine Learning model.
4. README file

## Instructions
1. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up the database and model.

    - To run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in database
        `python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db`
    - To run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves
        `python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl`

2. Run the following command in the app's directory to run your web app.
    `python run.py`
